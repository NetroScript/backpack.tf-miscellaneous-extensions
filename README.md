# backpack.tf * Miscellaneous Extensions

This is an userscript to add miscellaneous functionality to backpack.tf (which I would have liked for myself).
Currently included is:

* In inventories add a Group by paint
* In inventories add a Group by spell (including grouping and displaying double spelled items)
* In inventories add a Group by level
* In inventories add a Group by scm price
* In inventories add a Group by Classifieds (shows you all the listed items)
* In inventories add a Group by Craft numbers (cases and crates have their own category)
* Allow the reversion of the groups from a sort
* Filter by class on backpack.tf/effect/<effect>
* For unusuals you can not only filter for class but now also filter for miscs (manually curated list, if you want more open an issue)
* Improve classifieds / premium search
  * Autocomplete skin names
  * Filter unusual effects
* Marketplace link for any item
* Premium search for decorated weapons
* Spells are highlighted in inventories (green dotted lower border for 1 spell, red for multiple spells)
* If possible a trade offer link will be added to the profile links, so you can offer a trade even when the user has no listed item
* Utilities for Killstreak Kits
  * Shortcuts to different Killstreak tiers of one weapon, including shortcuts to either the fabricators or kits
  * Group by Killstreak Kits in inventories
