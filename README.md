# backpack.tf - Miscellaneous Extensions
_____________________________________________
This is an userscript to add miscellaneous functionality to backpack.tf (which I would have liked for myself).
Currently included is:
* In inventories add a Sort by paint
* In inventories add a Sort by spell
* In inventories add a Sort by level
* In inventories add a Sort by scm price
* In inventories add a Sort by Classifieds (shows you all the listed items)
* Allow the reversion of the groups from a sort
* Filter by class on backpack.tf/effect/<effect>
* For unusuals you can not only filter for class but now also filter for miscs (manually curated list, if you want more open an issue)
* When building a search for classifieds or premium you now can autocomplete skin names
* Marketplace link for any item
* Spells are highlighted in inventories (green dotted lower border for 1 spell, red for multiple spells)



## Installation
_____________________________________________
Use an extension which can execute userscripts (F.e. [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox))
and then install using this link: [backpack.tf extended sorting.user.js](https://github.com/NetroScript/backpack.tf-miscellaneous-extensions/raw/master/backpack.tf%20extended%20sorting.user.js).

(Or paste / install it manually for your plugin)

## Changelog

Improved:

* After a backpack update changed the name from "Sort by" to "Group by" it was also changed in this userscript
* Replaced the default Group by item index (because that grouped only per page). By default this will now add 1 group for every defindex, if you want all items in a single page ordered instead of per defindex there is a variable singlepage in the code which you can set to true

#### 0.1.13

Added:

#### 0.1.7

Fixed:
* Marketplace link appearing multiple times when hovering multiple times
* Marketplace link now only appears if no price is known

#### 0.1.6

Added:
* In the popover of an item, show a link to the marketplace item (So you have a link even when there are no sales)

#### 0.1.5

Added:
* Like with my custom sorting methods you can now reverse the groups of the already implemented sorting methods (so you can switch f.e. between old to new and new to old when sorting by time)

* On the pricelist page of unusual effects you now can filter them by class like the unusual by item page

* generic sort can now ignore empty pages
* spells are visually marked (green for 1 spell, red for multi-spell)
